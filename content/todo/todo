Why I Switched from Github Pages to Blogger.com 
  I discovered blogger.com when I was young. However, I did not like it because I felt that I did not have sufficient control over the page layouts and designs. I decided that I'll learn basic web development to create my own blog.

  Fast forward several years, I'm now a software engineering student and can do basic web stuff. I decided to make a blog with Jekyll on Github pages. It felt really cool because-
  Could write posts in markdown
  Full control over layout and design
  Comes with a nice domain name (yourname.github.io)
  Kinda nice to write code and do stuff
  Geeks use it
  Selecting a Jekyll theme was tough for me. I wasn't happy with existing themes so I decided to make my own custom UI. Although I was happy at first with my newly created blog, after several days, it did not feel right. I realized I am not that good with UI design (I'm more of a backend guy). Now I have to redesign it again. It's then when I realized, each time I sat down to write an article, I spent more time fine tuning my UI rather than actually writing the article.

  To be more productive in writing articles, this had to stop. Fast forward to today, I again explored blogger.com and decided to give it another try. The web interface restrains me from coding and keeps my focus on writing. 

  Other things that I like about blogger.com are
  Nice support for comments. (In github I needed third-party apps such as Disqus)
  In built statistics. (In github pages I had to add google analytics)
  Everything in the cloud, so I can access and edit posts from anywhere (In github pages I always needed my favorite text editor,  git and static site generator whenever I was in a new PC)
  Keeping drafts of ideas
  Wonderful mobile app which can be used even offline. It syncs later on wifi.
  Tweak designs with a few clicks.
  Very mobile friendly
  Don't get me wrong, I love github pages with Jekyll and its very cool. I still host my portfolio there (with hugo though). But for article writing, it's distracting and not for me. I'm staying with blogger.com to write articles for a long time to come.
