When I was about to start my undergrad in software engineering, I thought my courses would be called Java, C++, networking. 


When I first saw the course outline of my undergrad software engineering program, I was... well its not what I expected to see. I assumed the courses would be name C, C++, Java, Python and all sorts of programming stuff. To my surprise, there was not a single course that contained the name of a programming language. If you like me care to know about the courses in a software engineering degree, here, check out mine.

I'm also roughly putting down the sub-topics as far as I can remember.

Elective Courses
In the last semester, we have the option to choose two elective courses. The availability of a course depends on whether a teacher is offering it. In most cases, there isn't a lot of option. However, some of the courses in the official list are:
Software Metrics
Machine Learning
Modeling & Simulation
Microprocessor and Assembly Language
Embedded Systems
Data mining and Warehousing
Pattern Recognition and Image Processing
