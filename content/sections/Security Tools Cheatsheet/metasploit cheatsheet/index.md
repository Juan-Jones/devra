Metasploit is the ultimate testing tool for offensive security. The CLI is quite rich in the number of commands and I seem to easily forget them. Welp, no more forgetting, time to note them all down in one place.

## Getting started

```bash
# Start the console
$ msfconsole

# Show help
msf > help

# Update the msf database
msf > msfupdate
```

## Conclusion
