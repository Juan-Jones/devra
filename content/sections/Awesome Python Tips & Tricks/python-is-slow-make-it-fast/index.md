Python is known for being slow in its execution speed. Yes, although Python is slow, there are ways we can improve it.

Ways to improve:

1. Identify slow functions and improve them
1. Use built-in data types instead of custom ones
1. Use a cache
1. Use local variables
1. Reduce access to attributes
1. Beware of strings
1. Use generators

Use Built-in Data Types
This one is pretty obvious. Built-in data types are very fast, especially in comparison to our custom types like trees or linked lists. That's mainly because the built-ins are implemented in C, which we can't really match in speed when coding in Python.

## Conclusion

First rule of optimization is to not do it. But, if you really have to, then I hope these few tips help you with that.
