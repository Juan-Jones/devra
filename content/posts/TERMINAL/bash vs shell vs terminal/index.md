People often incorrectly use the terms bash, shell and terminal interchangeably. Whether you are a Linux pro or noob, maybe you've done it too. Here's what you should know when you use these terms the next time.

### Shell

> A shell is a program that takes command from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to execute.

In short a shell interacts with the OS for you.

So how do you interact with the shell? Through a terminal.

### Terminal

> Terminal is a graphical window that lets you interact with a shell.

There can be many implementations of a terminal. The default terminal in Ubuntu is the **gnome-terminal**. Other terminals you can checkout are:
- Tilda
- Guake
- Terminology

### Bash

> Bash is an implementation of a shell program

Just like a terminal can have different implementations, so can shells. Different implementations of shells are found and Bash is just one of the most popular of them. 

Linux started out with the **sh** shell. Later it was improved and  renamed as **Bourne again shell** (i.e **Bash**). Some other shells you can try out are:
- Zsh
- tsh
- fish shell
