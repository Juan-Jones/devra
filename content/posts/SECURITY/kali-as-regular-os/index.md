If you are an aspiring pentester you should definitely use Kali Linux and make it your primary OS. Switching to a new OS can be a very hard decision to make. Concerns such as whether you can do your regular work may rise. It has been quite a while (3 years) since I am using Kali as my primary OS and here are my experiences with it.

If you are shifting from a Windows environment and have no prior experience with Linux operating systems it's best not to move to Kali just yet. Try some other beginner-friendly Linux distributions like **Ubuntu** or **Mint** before using Kali.

If you are moving from Ubuntu or any other Linux environments (more specifically, from Debian derivates) you will find almost no differences between them. Kali is a Debian derivative. You can do absolutely anything on Kali that you can do on Ubuntu. 

Kali was never a barrier for my regular work as a programmer. I have had several IDEâ€™s installed on it- Eclipse, PyCharm, IntelliJ, CodeBlocks, Android studio, and never had any issues during installation or after installing it. Any programming languages compile and run just fine. Both pre-compiled binaries and compiled on machine binaries work without issues. I can do image editing with GIMP and Inkscape. I also use Virtualbox to run other operating systems virtually and everything works without issues. 

Since Kali is a rolling distro (frequents updates delivered) you always get to play with the latest software. However, there is also a downside to it. Sometimes frequent updates can break working software. Once my entire OS crashed and I had to reinstall it again (but it was just once). So I recommend not updating very frequently.

There are some other minor issues with Kali. It is not as stable or performant as Ubuntu. I had to deal with some minor bugs regarding UI and the desktop environment. Other than these I had no problems.

Overall, I have a pretty good user experience with Kali Linux as my main OS. If you are aiming to be a pentester but in doubt, whether you should switch OS or not, I would definitely recommend you to make the move.
