## Introduction

The first step to evaluate a target or launching an attack on a target is to gather information about it. The internet contains an abundance of data available for anyone to access. However, with so much information out there, it can be challenging to know where to start looking and how to filter out irrelevant data to obtain valuable insights. This is where OSINT comes in. **OSINT, or Open-Source Intelligence, refers to the collection and analysis of publicly available information to generate actionable intelligence.** 

In this post, I will my share my OSINT workflow and some useful tips, including the best tools to use and how to effectively approach OSINT investigations. Whether you're a researcher, analyst, or investigator, this post will provide you with the necessary skills to get started as an OSINT practitioner.

## What are the steps of performing OSINT?

1. **Define the scope and objective of the investigation:** The first step is to define the scope and objective of the investigation. This includes identifying the questions you need to answer, the sources of information you will be analyzing, and the timeframe for the investigation.

1. **Gather information:** The next step is to gather information from various sources. This includes online sources such as social media, forums, blogs, and websites, as well as offline sources such as public records, news articles, and reports.

1. **Organize and analyze data:** Once you have gathered the information, the next step is to organize and analyze the data. This involves using tools such as spreadsheets, databases, and visualization software to categorize and analyze the information.

1. **Verify the information:** It's important to verify the information to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This involves cross-checking information from multiple sources and using tools such as reverse image search to verify the authenticity of images.

1. **Draw conclusions and generate insights:** After verifying the information, the next step is to draw conclusions and generate insights based on the data. This involves looking for patterns, connections, and anomalies in the data, and identifying key insights that can help answer the initial questions.

1. **Report and present findings:** The final step is to report and present the findings of the investigation. This involves creating a comprehensive report that includes the key insights, the sources of information used, and the methodology used to conduct the investigation. It's important to present the findings in a clear and concise manner that is easy to understand.

OSINT Framework is the most extensive repository of tools for OSINT information gathering and investigations. It sorts the resources into 32 categories based on the type of data investigators are looking for: Public records, social networks, images, videos, digital currency, dark web, archives, and more. In each category, you can find free and paid tools that can be used to locate the data in question.
