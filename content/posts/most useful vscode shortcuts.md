VScode is my go-to editor now, but I keep forgetting all the nice shortcuts and commands. This article is a cheat sheet for me to look back when I forget my favorite ones.

VScode has different key bindings for each OS. Although most of the following should be general, if any of them isn't working, the full bindings are available here for Linux, Windows, MacOS.

## Editing

> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + X        Cut line (no need for selection)
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + C        Copy line (no need for selection)
> <kbd>Alt</kbd> + ↓ / ↑     Move line up/down
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + /          Toggle line comment
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +Shift+I  Format document
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + .          Quick fix
> <kbd>F12</kbd>               Rename symbol
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + H        Find and Replace
