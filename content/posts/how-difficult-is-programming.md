One of the first questions asked by beginners who want to start programming is, "How difficult is programming?" The answer in short is, <!-- more --> **learning a programming language is easy. Writing a good program is difficult**.

Think about it this way. You know English, but are you a good writer? To be a good writer you'll need years of practice and dedication before you can write something that will be appreciated by all. Not everyone can produce something like _Harry Potter_ or _The Lord of the Rings_. Knowing English and writing literature are two very different things.

It is no different in the software world. Learning a programming language is very easy. You can learn most programming languages very well in a matter of 2 months (you need patience though). But learning how to write a good program can take years to master. There are so many things to know and concepts to grasp that is needed to make a good program. Not everyone can make something like _Google_ or _Facebook_. Knowing how to write code and being a good developer are two very different things.

How much difficulty you'll face learning programming depends on what level of expertise you want to achieve. If you want to have fun writing a few small programs or simple mobile applications, it is easy and you should go for it! If you want to make something big and impactful, scalable and powerful which associates lots of users, then things will be a bit more challenging. However, though challenges in life might be difficult, they are the most rewarding. Games are only enjoyable when the levels get harder.

So, if you want to be a hobbyist programmer, learn to code, it's easy! If you want to be a professional programmer, learn to code, it's worth the effort!
