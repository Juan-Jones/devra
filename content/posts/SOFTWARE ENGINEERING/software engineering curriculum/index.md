---

Before I started my undergrad in software engineering, I didn't have the slightest idea of what courses I would be offered. I assumed they would be called something like "Java", "C++" or "networking". To my surprise, there was not a single course that contained the name of a programming language.

If you, like me, are curious about what courses we take or are generally interested to know what courses a SE degree offers this article is for you. I have completed my 4 years of Bachelor's in Software Engineering and I can show you what I went through over the years. In this article I will list what courses that I took and what was the syllabus of each course.

This article will also be helpful for those who are thinking of becoming **self taught programmers**. Because you'll-
* know exactly what courses we take
* know about courses/topics you haven't heard before
* know what courses to avoid so that you can achieve your goals faster
