If you've discovered Kali Linux and thinking about how you can hack with it, you probably can't and you’re probably walking in the wrong direction.

Kali is not a magic OS that can hack everything. It is just an operating system that comes with preinstalled pentesting tools. Now, you really cannot expect a tool to do everything by itself. You need to understand when it works, where it works, and how it works.

Think of it like this, a pen is a tool for writing. A baby scribbling with it won’t make writing come out of it. At first, he needs to learn how the alphabets look. Once he learns the alphabets he will learn to draw them. And after some practice, he will be able to write a letter. Then from letters to words, and then sentences

The tools in Kali are no different. There are so many things you need to learn before you can actually use the tools for hacking. **Operating systems, networking, protocols, programming languages, algorithms, cryptography**, and a _LOT_ of other concepts. Only after you have grasped the basics, you can start playing with the Kali tools. Know that knowledge required for hacking takes time to learn (unless you’re some kind of prodigy). There is no hack to become a hacker.

The nontechnical people have defined the term hacker to be a bad person who gets to any computers and do ay stuff. But **hackers are actually people who sit in a place for hours and learn a craft by testing and exploring**. You should know that Kali was not designed to be a hacker’s tool. It was designed to be a pentester’s tool. The difference is that a hacker uses Kali to exploit a system and a pentester finds a vulnerability in a system to fix it.

Kali may help you along the way, but it won’t take you to your destination . The tools are there only to help you. As for the real deal, you need to do that by yourself. So learn programming, networking, and the things that can take you where you want to be. It will be time-consuming but it is the only way. You can't be a hacker just using Kali.

Also, don't get into illegal stuff. Rather, aspire to be a pentester who fixes systems. With great hacking power comes great responsibility!
