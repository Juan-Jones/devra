I've been working with bulma for a while. Although the desktop rendering worked well, there were issues with the mobile view:

#### Problem

1. There is like a white border on the right
2. The screen is scrollable towards the right (which should not be)

#### Problem fix

To fix this, add the following code

{{<highlight css>}}
.columns {
    margin: 0;
}
{{</highlight>}}

With the above css it should render properly.
