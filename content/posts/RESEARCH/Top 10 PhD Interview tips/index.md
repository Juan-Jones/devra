How to perform 10x better in an interview for your PhD position?

Here are the 9 most likely parts of the interview.

𝟏. 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: You will be asked to introduce yourself. You can do so by mentioning your name, qualifications, research experience, graduation school, etc. Better mention research that aligns with the target lab. You can also mention at least one aspect (if any) that truly makes you stand out. Be concise (say 2 min).

𝟐. 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: In some cases, you might be asked to give a brief presentation. You should pick a topic that you have full command over and also that is somewhat relevant to the target lab. This is where you can steal the show so give it your best shot. 

𝟑. 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧? To answer this question well, you should explore the target lab very well. Check out what kind of research they are doing, where their alumni are, and what are their prominent works. Build your case on top of these aspects to show why do your PhD in this lab.

𝟒. 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐚 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐟𝐢𝐭? Similar to the previous point, you need to find out what kind of research the lab does and what skills are required for conducting such research. Then, you can map your research background and skills with that of the target lab to illustrate why you are a good fit. 

𝟓. 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐡𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐰𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬: Perhaps, a question you can plan your answer before your interview. Pick a couple of strengths that can help you to execute the target PhD research. You can pick a weakness that some part of the PhD journey can help you to overcome.

𝟔. 𝐅𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐬 𝐚𝐟𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐡𝐃: There are multiple career paths that you can take after your PhD. These include postdoc, teaching, consultancy, and so on. Have solid reasons as to why you will pick a particular path. 

𝟕. 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐂𝐕: The interview panel is quite likely to ask your questions based on what you have mentioned in your CV. Make sure that you have carefully gone through your CV (e.g., your projects and research papers) and that you are able to answer questions about what you have mentioned in your CV.

𝟖. 𝐀𝐧𝐲 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐮𝐬? Don't say - no, I don't have any questions. This may indicate a lack of seriousness from your side. Prepare a couple of specific questions. For example, do you have a powerful computational cluster where I can run my big data experiments? 

𝟗. 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Sometimes, you might be asked some general questions. For example, what do you think about cultural diversity? Try to avoid any controversial answers.
