_If you want to know about research areas in Software Engineering and conferences/journals related to software engineering then this article is for you._

The Distributed Systems and Software Engineering (DSSE) group at the Institute of Information Technology (IIT) is an active group dedicated to Software Engineering research. The group was formed in Bangladesh in 2012 with a few members. Currently, it is a large group consisting of members all around the world.

Here is what the group has achieved over the years.

## Explored around 25 areas of software engineering

#### Areas explored in software testing

1. Test Coverage 
1. Test Case Auto-Generation
1. Performance Testing
1. Software Defect Prediction 
1. Test Case Prioritization 
1. Bug Triage
1. Bug Localization

#### Areas explored in cloud computing

1. Cloud Security 
1. Fault Tolerance
1. Resource Optimization

#### Other areas explored

1. Mobile Application
1. Automated Program Repair
1. Sentiment Analysis in Software Engineering
1. Code Refactoring
1. Comment Refactoring
1. Code Clone
1. Code Search
1. Code style
1. Code Smell
1. Project management
1. Resource Provisioning 
1. Static/Dynamic Analysis

The following chart shows the number of publications in each research area (as of April 2019).

## Conferences and Journals

DSSE publishes its findings in both conferences and journals. However, publications in conferences are more preferred. This is because software engineering is very dynamic and thus concepts and ideas can change rapidly. Since the review processes of journals are generally longer than conferences, it may occur that by the time a paper is published in a journal, the concept has lost its shine. The review process of conferences are usually shorter (3-5 months) and thus preferred. The following shows the percentage of conferences and journals DSSE has published in.
