A long time ago in my 4th semester of university, our professor taught us to do proper requirements engineering before starting to write code. However, this was quite some time ago and I kind of forgot many of the things.

A few days back a relative of mine asked me if I could


The task was to build an ecommerce site for their clothing store. Its trivial. Simple wordpress ecommerce site. I was a bit busy so I requested two of juniors to do it for me. I would be the middleman, coordinating things from both perspectives.

As the task was trivial, just get a theme and plug and play. I did not bother going into the details of what would be done and what would not be done, didnt maintain a checklist. 

They were also not so expreieced. 

Of course some form of payment was there.

Point to be noted they need the website quicklly, before eid, a major festival that really sells clothes. Also this was within covid 19.

So here's what happened first they developed a site using a free theme. The free theme was not suiting exactly as the clients requested. They wanted minor tweaks. 

My bros put all their effort into tweaking the theme by modifying internal css and html. For example converting the dropdowns to mega menus, changing primary and seondary colors, and thus also changing the font colors witht them. Now changing these things on a manually coded site is no big deal. But on a wordpress theme that does not support it, its very hard to change.

So here is where we dit it wrong. We didn't make a checklist of the features we were going to provide and seal the contract. If we had the contract sealed then they woulld have no scope to ask for extra modifications without extra payments. For now they had all the leverage. They thought everything was easy and doable but they were not.

So next time you deliver a project make sure you make a checklist of all the features you are going to deliver, and if a cllient asks you to modify anything over it, you will have ther leverage to charge them for the extra effort your providing.
