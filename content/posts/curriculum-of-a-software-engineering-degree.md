When I was about to start my undergrad in software engineering, I thought my courses would be called Java, C++, networking. 

When I first saw the course outline of my undergrad software engineering program, I was... well its not what I expected to see. I assumed the courses would be name C, C++, Java, Python and all sorts of programming stuff. To my surprise, there was not a single course that contained the name of a programming language. If you like me care to know about the courses in a software engineering degree, here, check out mine.

I'm also roughly putting down the sub-topics as far as I can remember.

- [1st Semester](#1st-semester)
- [2nd Semester](#2nd-semester)
- [3rd Semester](#3rd-semester)
- [4th Semester](#4th-semester)
- [5th Semester](#5th-semester)
- [6th Semester](#6th-semester)
- [7th Semester](#7th-semester)
- [8th Semester](#8th-semester)

In the last semester, we have the option to choose two elective courses. The availability of a course depends on whether a teacher is offering it. In most cases, there isn't a lot of option. However, some of the courses in the official list are:
1. Software Metrics
1. Machine Learning
1. Modeling & Simulation
1. Microprocessor and Assembly Language
1. Embedded Systems
1. Data mining and Warehousing
1. Pattern Recognition and Image Processing
