Once one of my biology teachers (boma Mizan :p ) said that biological names are used everywhere in technology. I suddenly recalled that memory and now I'm making a list of every biological name used in technology.

1. **Amazon**: Amazon is a rainforest in South America. Amazon is an American company focusing on e-commerce.
1. **Anaconda**: Anaconda is a snake. Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python programming language for scientific computation.
1. **Apple**: Apple is a fruit. Apple is an American tech company.
1. **Bug**: Bug is a kind of insect. Bug is an error that occurs in software.
1. **Cat**: Cat is a meow. Cat is a Linux program to concatenate multiple files (The name actually comes from concatenating though)
1. **Cucumber**: Cucumber is a fruit. Cucumber is a software testing tool that supports behavior-driven development.
1. **Python**: Python is a snake. Python is a popular programming language.
1. **Gopher**: Gopher is a kind of rodent. Gopher is a TCP/IP application layer protocol. Also, Google has developed a programming language called Go whose mascot is a Gopher.
1. **Hydra**: Hydra is a fresh-water organism. Hydra is a brute force password cracker.
1. **Leaf**: Leaf is a flat blade-like structure of a plant. Leaf is a node of a Tree data structure.
1. **Mouse**: Mouse is a kind rodent. Mouse is an input device for controlling the cursor of a computer.
1. **Neuron**: Neuron is a nerve cell. Neuron is the basic unit of a neural network which is used in machine learning.
1. **Raspberry Pi**: Raspberry is a fruit. Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer.
1. **RAT**: Rat is a kind of rodent. RAT is a Remote Acess Trojan which is used as a backdoor to access PCs without a victim's knowledge.
1. **Shell**: Shell is a hard outer covering of some marine animals. Shell is a program that communicates with the operating system of a computer.
1. **Spyder**: Spider is an insect. Spyder is a platform for scientific programming in Python.
1. **Tardigrade**: Tardigrade is the most resilient known micro animal which can survive in the most extreme conditions. Project Tardigrade is a research project led by Microsoft which aims to achieve fault resilient servers, just like a Tardigrade.
1. **Tree**: Tree is a perennial plant. Tree is a data structure (a structure to keep data organized).
1. **Virus**: Virus is a microscopic parasite. Virus is a type of malicious software that can spread itself.
1. **Web**: Web is a spide house. Web is the internet.
1. **Worm**: Worm is a cylindrical animal. Worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer.

I'm pretty sure there's a lot more out there. Help me expand this list by commenting down below.
