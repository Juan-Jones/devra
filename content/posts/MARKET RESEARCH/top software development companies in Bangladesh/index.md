As a fresher after graduating from university, I only knew a handful names of good and renowned software companies . Now that I have somewhat explored the industry, applied to many companies, and have feedback from friends about some companies, I thought I would make a list of reputed companies where freshers could try applying.

This list is based solely on the opinions of me and my friends. If you think a company should be added or removed from the list, contact me via email.

Also, this list does not include many companies intentionally. Those are the sort of companies that ask for 2 years experience, 20 skills and offer 5000 BDT per month.
