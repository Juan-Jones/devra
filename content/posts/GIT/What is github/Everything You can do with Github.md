Github is the go to place for storing source code for developers. You are missing out on all the good bits of Github if you only use it for storing your code. Using Github to its full potential will make your life as a developer easier and more productive. In this article, I'll show you all the great stuff you can do with Github.

Let's go from the most used features to lesser known ones.

1. Code Hosting

Of course, this is what Github is most known for. Keep a backup of your source code online, be it public or private and access with ease.

2. Code Collaboration

The magic of code collaboration at Github happens with **Pull Requests (PR)** and **Code Reviews**. Master them to fully collaborate with developers around the world.

3. Issue tracker

An issue tracking system is a must have for any software team. GitHub's Issue Tracker is your treasure map for project bugs, features, and todos. Streamline teamwork by tagging, assigning, and discussing tasks in one central hub. 

4. Releasing Software

The **Releases page** in a repo acts as the launchpad of many software. Binary files, executables and compiled scripts meant for client usage can be kept here with proper versioning.

5. Wikis & Documentation

GitHub Wikis and Documentation are a knowledge oasis projects. Create crystal-clear guides, tutorials, and FAQs to welcome users and contributors with open arms. Elevate your project with organized wisdom, making the journey from setup to mastery a breeze!

6. Project Board

The Project Management steers your team's ship through waves of tasks and milestones. Visualize progress, create tickets, streamline workflows, and captain your projects to success with customizable boards and agile insights. From ideation to completion, set sail for efficiency and conquer the seas of collaboration!

7. Portfolio

Your profile on Github can act as a great portfolio. Customize your profile to show off projects you are proud of or show off your coding stats with style. 

8. Social media

All the great developers are on Github. So follow your favorite devs and see what they are doing and how they are doing it. Although you can't directly message developers yet, you can always communicate trhough discussions, PRs and issues or maybe even dig up their social links. [Follow me!](https://github.com/rafed)

9. Follow News

[Explore](https://github.com/explore) the latest [topics](https://github.com/topics), [trends](https://github.com/trending), updates, and innovations in the tech world. From open-source breakthroughs to programming insights, GitHub's newsfeed keeps you plugged into the pulse of the digital landscape.

10. Place for learning

Not all repositories in Github are codebases. A plethora of repositories contain just educational contents, coding challenges, and resources that empower your growth as a developer. From tutorials to real-world projects, GitHub is where knowledge flows freely aiding your journey to mastery.

11. Host static sites

Scared of paying high fees for hosting? Host static websites on Github Pages for FREE. Use it for personal portfolios or project documentation, or whatever static site you want. GitHub Pages makes static site hosting a breeze for tech enthusiasts and creators alike. This very blog and even [my portfolio](https://rafed.github.io/) is hosted on Github pages.

12. Code search engine

Where Google search results will fail to bring you a code snippet, Github code search will succeed. Explore an expansive realm of code using GitHub's search engine, unveiling libraries, snippets, and insights to fuel your projects.

13. CI/CD platform

Embrace the power of CI/CD pipelines to seamlessly test, build, and deploy your projects, automating the journey from code to production. With GitHub Actions as your CI/CD, deliver software better, safer and faster.

14. Virtual coding environment

Tired of setting up your coding environment every time in a new computer? Enter codespaces! Step into a virtual environment with codespaces, transforming any browser into a VScode editor. Code, build, and even run servers directly from your browser seamlessly! 

15. Sponsorships

Are you a maintainer of an awesome repository that people find useful? Ask for sponsorships by attaching a sponsorship button to your repo. Get funded by the community to sustain your open-source projects and turn your passiong into a possibility.

16. Classroom

Are you a teacher? Streamline assignments and coding exercises in a structured, collaborative environment, where teachers guide and students thrive. Automatically grade assignments and review code for a better teaching experience.

17. A data mine

Github is a gold mine of software artifacts. With all the different repositories, discussions, bug reports and PRs, it is a great source of data. This data can be used by researchers to get insights and develop new tools. And the great part is that all this data is available through the Github REST API.
