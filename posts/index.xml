After I discovered blogger.com, I thought I could improve my blogging experience with it. So I made the switch and these were my reasons.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a suitable Jekyll theme for my blog. So I made one for myself. Not being a good UI designer, I made a pretty bad theme. With Blogger.com&amp;rsquo;s WYSIWYG editor I thought I could make a better looking site.</description></item><item><title>Fix bulma mobile view problem</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/fix-bulma-mobile-view-problem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/fix-bulma-mobile-view-problem/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with bulma for a while.

A research paper typically has the following sections:

I didn&amp;rsquo;t like this course very much. It was theoretical and a bit boring. I&amp;rsquo;m usually fond of more practical stuff.
In most of our courses, we have to complete a project by the end of the semester. For the software metrics course, we were to build a tool that shows several known metrics of a Java program.</description></item><item><title>Parsing C++/Java/C# the Easy Way (with srcML)</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/parsing-cpp-java-cs-with-srcml/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/parsing-cpp-java-cs-with-srcml/</guid><description>Recently I needed to parse C++ code to analyze some projects. I tried out several parsers (clang, libclang, cppast) but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get them to work for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find their documentation easy to understand. That&amp;rsquo;s maybe because I&amp;rsquo;m not so familiar with the C++ ecosystem. I suffered for quite a while until I found this awesome tool called srcML.
srcML is a lightweight tool for the exploration of source code that presents source code in an XML format.</description></item><item><title>Why even noobs should participate in CTFs</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/why-even-noobs-should-participate-in-ctfs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/why-even-noobs-should-participate-in-ctfs/</guid><description>A few days back Facebook held their first-ever CTF and Google also held theirs a few days later. Although I occasionally goof around with CTFs, I&amp;rsquo;m no expert at it. Despite this, I decided to take an attempt. I was skeptical at first but it turned out to be an awesome experience.
In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know what a CTF (capture the flag) is, it&amp;rsquo;s almost like a treasure hunt where you have to find a treasure by exploiting security loopholes.</description></item><item><title>Bare minimum Multi-tasking guide for the terminal with Tmux</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/multitasking-in-terminal-with-tmux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/multitasking-in-terminal-with-tmux/</guid><description>Have you ever-

Switching to a new OS can be a very hard decision to make. Concerns such as whether you can do your regular work may rise. It has been quite a while (3 years) since I am using Kali as my primary OS and here are my experiences with it.
If you are shifting from a Windows environment and have no prior experience with Linux operating systems it&amp;rsquo;s best not to move to Kali just yet.</description></item><item><title>How many programming languages should I learn</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/how-many-programming-languages-to-learn/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/how-many-programming-languages-to-learn/</guid><description>Has it ever occurred to you, that you see a new programming language and you feel an urge to learn it? If love hobby programming then I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that you&amp;rsquo;ve had this dilemma of choosing whether to learn a language or not. Sometimes the fear of missing out makes us want to learn as many languages as possible. But how many languages do we actually need to learn?
Every language out there have their specialty that makes it worth learning.</description></item><item><title>How to be a hacker with Kali</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/be-hacker-with-kali/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/be-hacker-with-kali/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered Kali Linux and thinking about how you can hack with it, you probably can&amp;rsquo;t and youâ€™re probably walking in the wrong direction.
Kali is not a magic OS that can hack everything. It is just an operating system that comes with preinstalled pentesting tools. Now, you really cannot expect a tool to do everything by itself. You need to understand when it works, where it works, and how it works.</description></item><item><title>DSSE: A software engineering research group in Bangladesh</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/research/software-engineering-research-and-dsse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/research/software-engineering-research-and-dsse/</guid><description>If you want to know about research areas in Software Engineering and conferences/journals related to software engineering then this article is for you.

High config AWS or GCP is really expensive so they were looking for alternatives. That&amp;rsquo;s when our professor told them to meet a guy called Mahedi. They dragged me along to meet him and I&amp;rsquo;m glad that they did.
So Mahedi bhai works at BdREN (Bangladesh Education and Research Network). BdREN connects all the public Universities in Bangladesh through a fiber-optic network and provides fast internet and other cloud services.</description></item><item><title>draw.io - Best online prototyping tool</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/draw-io/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/draw-io/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a free and awesome prototyping/wireframing/mockup UI tool, search no more, go to draw.io
There are a lot of prototyping tools available online but most of them are very annoying. Either they are paid or requires signing up. And the most annoying are the ones where you&amp;rsquo;ve finally drawn something and then they say you need to sign up to download the image.
Draw.io is the tool that works best for me.</description></item><item><title>Image clustering</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/image-clustering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/image-clustering/</guid><description>Clustering is a technique to group similar elements together.

Linux computers are almost immune to viruses. Yes, I said &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo; immune. But the percentage of PCs being affected is very less, even less than 1%. That is why people say that Linux does not need any antivirus. But why is that have you ever wondered? Here are the top 5 reasons why viruses do not affect Linux.</description></item></channel></rss>
