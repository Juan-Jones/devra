If love hobby programming then I&rsquo;m pretty sure that you&rsquo;ve had this dilemma of choosing whether to learn a language or not. Sometimes the fear of missing out makes us want to learn as many languages as possible. But how many languages do we actually need to learn?</p><p>Every language out there have their specialty that makes it worth learning. But here’s what you should really keep in mind before learning a new language - that is, <strong>goal-based learning</strong>.</p><p>You should focus on the goal you’d like to achieve in the long run, not just the language itself. Just knowing a language wouldn’t benefit you. After all, it is just a tool, and having a tool is useless unless you’re using it for something. Additionally, a tool not being used will get rusty. If you don&rsquo;t use a language after learning it, you’ll forget it. That&rsquo;s time and hard work wasted.</p><p>Ask yourself, what am I going to do after learning this language? If you have a clear answer go for it. If not, you&rsquo;re probably not going to need it soon.</p><p>It has been quite a while since Rust came out. It&rsquo;s like a more modern C++. I almost wanted to learn it. But then I realized, I’m not really a system programmer and neither do I intend to be one soon. So it’s probably not worth it for me to learn it yet.</p><p>I was a Java guy before I started to do machine learning. After exploring ML out a bit I found that the Python libraries are easier and more helpful to do ML. I knew I&rsquo;d need ML in the long run, so it was then when I decided that I need to learn Python.</p><p>So the thing is, learn programming languages as the need arises. Don’t learn them for the sake of learning. You’ll be wasting your time and energy.</p><p>Sometimes, knowing a lot of languages is helpful. If you’re into security then knowing a lot of languages is definitely a plus. Senior developers may need to know multiple languages if they are supervising teams that work with multiple languages. But they don&rsquo;t learn it all at once. As the years go by, they gradually pick up new languages.</p><p>So, remember boys (and gals), <strong>goal-based learning</strong>!</p></div></div><div id=social-media-share class=has-text-centered><p><i>Sharing is caring!</i></p><br><div class=share-buttons><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2frafed.github.io%2fdevra%2fposts%2fhow-many-programming-languages-to-learn%2f" onclick="socialMediaPopUp(this.href,'',500,500);return false;" title="Share on Facebook.
