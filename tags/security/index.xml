What does bother me is that people spread fake news and some idiots believe them. And at times I have been unlucky to be on the &amp;ldquo;idiot&amp;rdquo; side of things.
Why people make fake news? The opportunities are endless&amp;hellip;

Linux computers are almost immune to viruses. Yes, I said &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo; immune. But the percentage of PCs being affected is very less, even less than 1%.
