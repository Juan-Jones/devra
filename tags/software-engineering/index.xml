I tried out several parsers (clang, libclang, cppast) but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get them to work for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find their documentation easy to understand. That&amp;rsquo;s maybe because I&amp;rsquo;m not so familiar with the C++ ecosystem. I suffered for quite a while until I found this awesome tool called srcML.
srcML is a lightweight tool for the exploration of source code that presents source code in an XML format.</description></item><item><title>draw.io - Best online prototyping tool</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/draw-io/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/draw-io/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a free and awesome prototyping/wireframing/mockup UI tool, search no more, go to draw.io
There are a lot of prototyping tools available online but most of them are very annoying. Either they are paid or requires signing up. And the most annoying are the ones where you&amp;rsquo;ve finally drawn something and then they say you need to sign up to download the image.
Draw.io is the tool that works best for me.</description></item></channel></rss>
