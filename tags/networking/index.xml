High config AWS or GCP is really expensive so they were looking for alternatives. That&amp;rsquo;s when our professor told them to meet a guy called Mahedi. They dragged me along to meet him and I&amp;rsquo;m glad that they did.
So Mahedi bhai works at BdREN (Bangladesh Education and Research Network). BdREN connects all the public Universities in Bangladesh through a fiber-optic network and provides fast internet and other cloud services.</description></item></channel></rss>
