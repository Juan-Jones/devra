I didn&amp;rsquo;t like this course very much. It was theoretical and a bit boring. I&amp;rsquo;m usually fond of more practical stuff.
In most of our courses, we have to complete a project by the end of the semester. For the software metrics course, we were to build a tool that shows several known metrics of a Java program.</description></item></channel></rss>
